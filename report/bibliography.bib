  year       = {2016},
  abstract   = {Spatial and temporal contextual information plays a key role for analyzing user behaviors, and is helpful for predicting where he or she will go next. With the growing ability of collecting information, more and more temporal and spatial contextual information is collected in systems, and the location prediction problem becomes crucial and feasible. Some works have been proposed to address this problem, but they all have their limitations. Factorizing Personalized Markov Chain (FPMC) is constructed based on a strong independence assumption among different factors, which limits its performance. Tensor Factorization (TF) faces the cold start problem in predicting future actions. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) model shows promising performance comparing with PFMC and TF, but all these methods have problem in modeling continuous time interval and geographical distance. In this paper, we extend RNN and propose a novel method called Spatial Temporal Recurrent Neural Networks (ST-RNN). ST-RNN can model local temporal and spatial contexts in each layer with time-specific transition matrices for different time intervals and distance-specific transition matrices for different geographical distances. Experimental results show that the proposed ST-RNN model yields significant improvements over the competitive compared methods on two typical datasets, i.e., Global Terrorism Database (GTD) and Gowalla dataset.},

  year       = {2016},
  abstract   = {In this paper, we address the problem of personalized next Point-of-interest (POI) recommendation which has become an important and very challenging task in location-based social networks (LBSNs), but not well studied yet. With the conjecture that, under different contextual scenario, human exhibits distinct mobility patterns, we attempt here to jointly model the next POI recommendation under the influence of user's latent behavior pattern. We propose to adopt a third-rank tensor to model the successive check-in behaviors. By incorporating softmax function to fuse the personalized Markov chain with latent pattern, we furnish a Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) approach and derive the optimization criterion accordingly. Expectation Maximization (EM) is then used to estimate the model parameters. Extensive experiments on two large-scale LBSNs datasets demonstrate the significant improvements of our model over several state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract = {Watching television tends to be a social activity. So, adaptive television needs to adapt to groups of users rather than to individual users. In this paper, we discuss different strategies for combining individual user models to adapt to groups, some of which are inspired by Social Choice Theory. In a first experiment, we explore how humans select a sequence of items for a group to watch, based on data about the individuals' preferences. The results show that humans use some of the strategies such as the Average Strategy (a.k.a. Additive Utilitarian), the Average Without Misery Strategy and the Least Misery Strategy, and care about fairness and avoiding individual misery. In a second experiment, we investigate how satisfied people believe they would be with sequences chosen by different strategies, and how their satisfaction corresponds with that predicted by a number of satisfaction functions. The results show that subjects use normalization, deduct misery, and use the ratings in a non-linear way. One of the satisfaction functions produced reasonable, though not completely correct predictions. According to our subjects, the sequences produced by five strategies give satisfaction to all individuals in the group. The results also show that subjects put more emphasis than expected on showing the best rated item to each individual (at a cost of misery for another individual), and that the ratings of the first and last items in the sequence are especially important. In a final experiment, we explore the influence viewing an item can have on the ratings of other items. This is important for deciding the order in which to present items. The results show an effect of both mood and topical relatedness.},

In this paper, we discuss our initial findings obtained from analyzing a vast corpus of almost 150 million bookmarks found at del.icio.us. Apart from investigating bookmarking and tagging patterns in this data, we discuss evidence that social bookmarking systems are vulnerable to spamming and hence need to be preprocessed before any insightful analysis can be carried out. We present a method, which limits the influence of spam in social bookmarking analysis and provide conclusions and directions for future research.},

  title      = {Exploring Millions of Footprints in Location Sharing Services},
  year       = {2011},
  abstract   = {Location sharing services (LSS) like Foursquare, Gowalla, and Facebook Places support hundreds of millions of user-driven footprints (i.e., "checkins"). Those global-scale footprints provide a unique opportunity to study the social and temporal characteristics of how people use these services and to model patterns of human mobility, which are significant factors for the design of future mobile+location-based services, traffic forecasting, urban planning, as well as epidemiological models of disease spread. In this paper, we investigate 22 million checkins across 220,000 users and report a quantitative assessment of human mobility patterns by analyzing the spatial, temporal, social, and textual aspects associated with these footprints. We find that: (i) LSS users follow the “Levy Flight” mobility pattern and adopt periodic behaviors; (ii) While geographic and economic constraints affect mobility patterns, so does individual social status; and (iii) Content and sentiment-based analysis of posts associated with checkins can provide a rich source of context for better understanding how users engage with these services.},

  title      = {Fused Matrix Factorization with Geographical and Social Influence in Location-Based Social Networks},
  year       = {2012},
  abstract   = {Recently, location-based social networks (LBSNs), such as Gowalla, Foursquare, Facebook, and Brightkite, etc., have attracted millions of users to share their social friendship and their locations via check-ins. The available check-in information makes it possible to mine users’ preference on locations and to provide favorite recommendations. Personalized Point-of-interest (POI) recommendation is a significant task in LBSNs since it can help targeted users explore their surroundings as well as help third-party developers to provide personalized services. To solve this task, matrix factorization is a promising tool due to its success in recommender systems. However, previously proposed matrix factorization (MF) methods do not explore geographical influence, e.g., multi-center check-in property, which yields suboptimal solutions for the recommendation. In this paper, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to fuse MF with geographical and social influence for POI recommendation in LBSNs. We first capture the geographical influence via modeling the probability of a user’s check-in on a location as a Multi-center Gaussian Model (MGM). Next, we include social information and fuse the geographical influence into a generalized matrix factorization framework. Our solution to POI recommendation is efficient and scales linearly with the number of observations. Finally, we conduct thorough experiments on a large-scale real-world LBSNs dataset and demonstrate that the fused matrix factorization framework with MGM utilizes the distance information sufficiently and outperforms other state-of-the-art methods significantly.},
